# Manipulating-Arrays
An array contains a set of data represented by a single variable name. 
PHP includes two types of arrays: indexed and associative. We refer to the elements in an indexed array by their numeric position, whereas we refer to the elements in an associative array with an alphanumeric key. 
In these Programms you will see how I have used advanced techniques on both indexed and associative arrays.
